Create SUSE LINUX 9.1 boot disks
================================

Due to increasing kernel size there are now three boot disks!

You can create the boot disks if you have access to either a running Linux
box or a running DOS box.

Under DOS, write bootdsk1, bootdsk2 and bootdsk3 to formatted (i.e.
error-free) 1.44MB-floppies using CD1:/dosutils/rawrite/rawrite.exe. For
Windows systems there is CD1:/dosutils/rawwritewin/rawwritewin.exe.

With Linux, use commands like:

  cd /where_CD1_is_mounted/boot

  # insert first boot floppy, then run:

  dd if=bootdsk1 of=/dev/fd0u1440

  # insert second boot floppy, then run:

  dd if=bootdsk2 of=/dev/fd0u1440

  # insert third boot floppy, then run:

  dd if=bootdsk3 of=/dev/fd0u1440

Now you have three boot disks. Start your computer using the first disk.


Create modules disks
====================

Only a few modules fit on the boot disk. Therefore five modules floppies
exist. If you do not find the driver for your hardware on the normal disk,
just insert the appropriate modules disk as soon as linuxrc asks for it.

Choose one of the modules disk images in this directory according to the
list below.

Under Windows/DOS, use rawrite as descibed in 'Create boot disks'. Under
Linux, use a command like

  cd /where_CD1_is_mounted/boot
  dd if=modules1 of=/dev/fd0u1440

Of course you would replace 'modules1' with the image name you want.

modules1:  USB and FireWire (IEEE1394) modules.

modules2:  IDE/RAID/SCSI modules.

modules3:  Network modules.

modules4:  PCMCIA and file system modules and old (non-ATAPI) CDROM drivers.

modules5:  More IDE/RAID/SCSI modules.

See modules[12345].txt for a detailed listing.



Create a rescue floppy
======================

There is already a rescue system on CD. But in case you cannot access the CD
or you just want a smaller rescue system, you can create a rescue floppy.

Under Windows/DOS, use rawrite as descibed in 'Create boot disks'. Under
Linux, use a command like

  cd /where_CD1_is_mounted/boot
  dd if=rescuefloppy of=/dev/fd0u1440



What are the other files in this directory?
===========================================

rescue:    (Large) rescue system.

root:      Installation system.

loader:    Boot loader and files it needs.
