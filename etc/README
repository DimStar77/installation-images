Creating SUSE LINUX 9.3 Boot Disks
----------------------------------

The boot files are split across six floppy disks.

You can create the boot disks if you have access to a running Linux
box or a running DOS box.

Under DOS, write bootdsk1-bootdsk6 to formatted (i.e., error-free)
1.44MB-floppies using CD1:/dosutils/rawrite/rawrite.exe. For Windows
systems, there is CD1:/dosutils/rawwritewin/rawwritewin.exe.

With Linux, use commands like:

  cd /where_CD1_is_mounted/boot

  # insert first boot floppy, then run:

  dd if=bootdsk1 of=/dev/fd0u1440

and repeat that with bootdsk2-bootdsk6.
  
Now you have six boot disks. Start your computer using the first disk.



Creating a Rescue Floppy
------------------------

There is already a rescue system on CD. If you cannot access the CD
or just want a smaller rescue system, you can create a rescue floppy.

Under Windows or DOS, use rawrite as described in 'Creating Boot Disks'. Under
Linux, use a command like

  cd /where_CD1_is_mounted/boot
  dd if=rescuefloppy of=/dev/fd0u1440
