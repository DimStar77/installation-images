A short description of the boot disks
-------------------------------------

All kernels are modularized. This means that almost all drivers are loaded
as kernel modules.

You can create a new boot/install floppy if you have access to either a
running Linux box or a running DOS box.

Choose one of the boot images in this directory according to the list below.

Under DOS, write it to a formatted (i.e. error-free) 1.44MB-floppy using
CD1:/dosutils/rawrite/rawrite.exe.

Under Linux, use a command like

  cd /whereCD1isMounted/disks
  dd if=./myBestBootImageAccordingToReadme of=/dev/fd0u1440

Now you have a new boot/install floppy which you can use to boot either the
installed system or the rescue system from CD.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
bootdisk:  Standard bootdisk

i386:      Fallback bootdisk for i386 and older Cyrix processors;
           has no frame buffer support

rescue:    Rescue disk

Only a few modules fit on the bootdisk. Therefore two modules floppies
exist. If you do not find the driver for your hardware on the normal disk,
just insert the appropriate modules disk as soon as linuxrc starts.

modules:   SCSI/RAID/EIDE and PCMCIA modules, old (non-ATAPI) CDROM drivers.

modules2:  Network modules.
