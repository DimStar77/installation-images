Creating SUSE LINUX 9.3 Boot Disks
----------------------------------

The boot files are split across several floppy disks.

To create boot disks, run 'mkbootdisk' (the program is in this directory) on
a Linux system:

1. Mount CD1 or DVD (e.g. to /media/cdrom).

2. Run
     /media/cdrom/boot/mkbootdisk /media/cdrom

   to create boot disk image files bootdisk1 - bootdiskN.

3. Write these image files to floppies, using e.g. 

     dd if=bootdisk1 of=/dev/fd0

   (and bootdisk2 - bootdiskN accordingly).

4. A short usage summary of 'mkbootdisk' gives

     mkbootdisk --help



Creating a Rescue Floppy
------------------------

There is already a rescue system on CD. If you cannot access the CD
or just want a smaller rescue system, you can create a rescue floppy.

Use a command like

  dd if=/where_CD1_is_mounted/boot/rescuefloppy of=/dev/fd0
