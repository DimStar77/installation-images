Upon starting YaSt2, linuxrc performs the following operations:

 - (*no* chroot is done)

 - mounting a 2nd ram disk with the "root" image (from "suse/images")

 - set up appropriate symlinks for
     /bin, /boot, /lib, /root, /sbin, /usr
   to point to the root image (note that these directories are typically
   mounted read-only)
   (the original "/bin" from the initrd is renamed to "/.bin")

 - write config data to "/etc/yast2rc"

 - start "/sbin/YaST2.start" (a shell script that finally starts "/sbin/YaST2")
   ("YaST2.start" is responsible to mount and setup the source medium; "YaST2"
   only starts the X server and "y2bignfat")

 - when YaST2 returns, the above operations are undone und control is given
   back to linuxrc

Please note: the CD or NFS volume is *not* mounted by linuxrc. It is done in
the "YaST2.start" script. linuxrc accesses the CD/the NFS dir only to
retrieve the "root" image, loads it and then unmounts the CD/NFS volume.


Format of "/etc/yast2rc":

  It is a simple script containing only shell variable assignments. No
  comments.

  It is the same format that is used for the yast2rc file thats put onto the
  boot disk for user default values.

  Currently these entries are used (see file.c in linuxrc):

  - BOOT_MODE
      "CD"	from CD
      "Net"	via NFS

  - BOOT_SRC
      source of boot medium suitable for a mount command; e.g.
      "/dev/sr0" for a CD or "10.10.0.10:/xyz" for NFS

  - INST_MOUNT_POINT
      directory the 2nd ram disk is mounted to (the "root" image in
      suse/images, *not* YaST2); normally "/inst-img"

  - NFS_SRV, NFS_DIR
      NFS installation source (cf. BOOT_SRC)

  - NET_IF
      the network interface *if* installation is over a network; e.g. "eth0"

  - NET_IP
      the host ip

  - NET_MASK, HOST_NAME, DOMAIN_NAME, GATEWAY, NAME_SRV
