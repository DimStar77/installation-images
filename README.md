# (open)SUSE installation images

## Documentation

Scripts and tools to generate the disk images used during installation
(inst-sys) and the rescue disk images for openSUSE and SUSE.

Further information can be found in the [included documentation](doc/README.md),
easily browsable online at
[ReadTheDocs.org](http://installation-images.readthedocs.org/).

## openSUSE Development

The package is automatically submitted from the `master` branch to
[system:install:head](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/system:install:head/installation-images)
OBS project. From that place it is forwarded to
[openSUSE Factory](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/openSUSE:Factory).

You can find more information about this workflow in the [linuxrc-devtools
documentation](https://github.com/openSUSE/linuxrc-devtools#opensuse-development).
