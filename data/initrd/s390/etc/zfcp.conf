# This file contains the zfc configuration as described
# in the section  SCSI-over-Fibre Channel driver  of
# the Device Driver Manual.
#
# WARNING: In case you modify the configuration in this
# file after finishing the installation of SuSE Linux
# Enterprise Server, you have to save it to the boot
# process (i.e. initrd) before the next reboot to make
# it persistent. Failing in doing so may leave your
# system in a misconfigured state after the next reboot
# which - in the worst case - may lead to data loss.
#
# To store the zfcp configuration to the boot process,
# follow these steps:
#
# * prepare an initial ramdisk (initrd) containing
#   the configuration:
#      mk_initrd
#
# * store the initrd to the boot loader:
#      zipl
#
# This file will then be written to
# /proc/scsi/zfcp/add_map at system boot.
#
# <devno> <Linux SCSI Port>:<fcp wwpn> <Linux SCSI Lun>:<fcp-lun>
#     devno = fcp adapter device number
#     fcp = fibre channel protocol
#     wwpn = world wide port number
#     lun = logical unit number
#
# always modify and uncomment this to match your local configuration:
