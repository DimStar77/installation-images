             Choose the device numbers you want to use for Linux 
                !!!    BE CAREFUL WHEN SELECTING DASDs -   !!!
                !!! YOU MAY DESTROY DATA ON SHARED DEVICES !!!

    1. Enter 'insmod dasd dasd=<list of devices>'
       Remember to separate devices by commas (<dev_no>,<dev_no>),
       syntax for ranges is <from_dev_no>-<to_dev_no>
       like 
              'insmod dasd dasd=FD00-FD0F,FD40,FD42,FD80-FD86'

       Note: When updating, you have to load the dasd driver with the
       same DASD order as in the installed system  - see documentation
       for further information.

    2. Start installation or update with  'YaST'.

       In case your function keys don't work, you can emulate them with
       Ctrl-F Number, e.g. for F1: Ctrl-F and then '1'.
